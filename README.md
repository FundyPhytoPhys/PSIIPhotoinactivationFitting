## Repo content information

Use the space below to summarize the structure of the repository with a decription of each folder, as applicable.

### MetaDataCatalog
URL for MetaDataCatalog, or MetaDataCatalog filename
example:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rlj03Q_wq83qlyiY7mXq8BK6C-L0Ko799JsyhfA1TGI/edit#gid=0
Use standard variable names for MetaDataCatalog

### Data/RawData

Raw data files in various formats. Original files generated by analytical equipment, received from a data provider or outside contractor, etc.
Subfolders contain files from a single instrument.
Do not create swarms of superfluous sub-folders.

### Data/CleanData

Clean data in formats for long-term storage. Modified data with the appropriate column/row headers and data structure.

### Data/ProcessedData

Processed data in formats for long-term storage.

### Code

Scripts for processing raw data into cleaned data, outside derived code, and user derived code.
A folder OldR is used to store outdated code.
Typically organize .Rmd in modules; Import; Tidy; Process saving .Rds out of each step.

### Docs

Project notes, other documentation, etc.

### Output

Output from knit .Rmd, Figures and tables produced from analysis.
Do not generate swarms of superfluous data exploration figures.
